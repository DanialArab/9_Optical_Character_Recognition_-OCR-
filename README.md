# 9 Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

During your grad study’s research and while trying to explain what you observed in the lab, you may find a really good but too old article that you think it could help you out a lot! You most likely want to quickly see if the data and the work’s details like experimental settings, modeling assumptions, the materials used, etc. can be beneficial to you. BUT after opening the article, you find out you’ve got a scanned copy, which is really time-consuming to scan/skim. This is what happened to me a lot during my Ph.D. and if I were in good luck, I could manage to find a pdf copy, which was not the case all the time. While doing machine learning (ML) research, I found out ML can come in handy to help us!

I just came across a very useful application of ML based on which, I defined a small project. In this study, OCR is applied to a classical article, published in J. of Canadian Petroleum Technology (1990) https://lnkd.in/e7eVbwXp
, to generate parsable contents out of a scanned version. The industrial real-world importance of OCR is to detect characters in images with a broad range of applications ranging from identifying license plates for public parking and transportation services (tried by Stadtwerke München company), automated exam assessment (tried by Cambridge Assessments company), Google Translate’s OCR addition (https://lnkd.in/exKpYYDc), document analysis in health care and insurance industries etc.
